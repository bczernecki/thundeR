**`thundeR`** is a freeware R package and collection of functions for rapid computation and visualisation of convective parameters commonly used in the operational forecasting of severe convective storms. Core algorithm is based on C++ code implemented into R language via RCPP. This solution allows to compute over 100 thermodynamic and kinematic parameters in less than 0.02s per profile and process large datasets such as reanalyses or operational NWP models in a reasonable amount of time. Package has been developed since 2017 by research meteorologists specializing in severe convective storms and is constantly updated with new features.

## Online browser:

Online rawinsonde browser of `thundeR` package is available at www.rawinsonde.com 


## Main functions:

- **`sounding_compute()`** - A core function for calculating convective parameters commonly used in the operational prediction of severe convective storms. Returns a vector of parameters.
 
- **`sounding_plot()`** - Function to plot a composite of Skew-T, hodograph and selected convective parameters on a single layout
- 
- **`sounding_save()`**` - Auxiliary function to `sounding_plot` that plots a composite of Skew-T, hodograph and selected convective parameters on a single layout and exports graphical file.

- **`get_sounding()`** - Download rawinsonde measurement from sounding database of the University of Wyoming in a form convenient to use with `thundeR` package.


## Examples

Examples show aplication of selected `thundeR` package functions

#### Example 1

Draw Skew-T, hodograph and convective parameters on a single layout and export to png file:

```{r example1, eval = TRUE, fig.width=9, fig.height=6, fig.fullwidth = TRUE}
library(thunder)
data("sounding_vienna") # load example dataset (Vienna rawinsonde profile for 23 Aug 2011 12UTC):
pressure = sounding_vienna$pressure # vector of pressure [hPa]
altitude = sounding_vienna$altitude # vector of altitude [meters]
temp = sounding_vienna$temp  # vector of temperature [degree Celsius]
dpt = sounding_vienna$dpt # vector of dew point temperature [degree Celsius]
wd = sounding_vienna$wd # vector of wind direction [azimuth in degrees]
ws = sounding_vienna$ws # vector of wind speed [knots]

### 2. Accuracy tables for `sounding_compute()` 

The interpolation algorithm used in the `sounding_compute()` function impacts accuracy of parameters such as CAPE or CIN and the performance of the script. The valid options for the `accuracy` parameter are 1, 2 or 3:

`accuracy = 1` - High performance but low accuracy. Dedicated for large dataset when output data needs to be quickly available (e.g. operational numerical weather models). This option is around 20 times faster than high accuracy (3) setting. Interpolation is peformed for 60 levels (m AGL): 

```{r accuracy1, echo = FALSE}
c(0, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000, 1100, 1200, 1300, 1400, 1600, 1800, 2000, 2200, 2400, 2600, 2800, 3000, 3200, 3400, 3600, 3800, 4000, 4200, 4400, 4600, 4800, 5000, 5200, 5400, 5600, 5800, 6000, 6500, 7000, 7500, 8000, 8500, 9000, 9500, 10000, 10500, 11000, 11500, 12000, 12500, 13000, 13500, 14000, 15000, 16000, 17000, 18000, 19000, 20000)

### Important notes

- Remember to always input wind speed data in knots. 
- Script will always consider first height level as the surface (h = 0), therefore input height data can be as above sea level (ASL) or above ground level (AGL). 
- For efficiency purposes it is highly recommended to input data for a maximum of 16-18 km AGL or lower.
- Values of parameters will be different for different accuracy settings.

`**thundeR**` is a freeware R package and collection of functions for rapid computation and visualisation of convective parameters commonly used in the operational prediction of severe convective storms. Core algorithm is based on a highly optimized C++ code implemented into R language via RCPP. This solution allows to compute over 100 thermodynamic and kinematic parameters in less than 0.02s per profile and process large numerical datasets such as reanalyses or operational NWP models in a fairly low amount of time. This package was developed by research meteorologists specializing in severe convective storms and is constantly updated with new features. Its main purpose is to allow operational meteorologists and researchers a quick and easy evaluation of convective environments..



## Main functions:

- `**sounding_compute()**` - Function for calculating convective parameters commonly used in the operational prediction of severe convective storms.
 
- `**sounding_plot()**` - Function to plot a composite of Skew-T, hodograph and selected convective parameters on a single layout

- `**sounding_save()**` - Auxiliary function to 'sounding_plot' that plots a composite \ of Skew-T, hodograph and selected convective parameters \ on a single layout and saves as graphical file.

- `**get_sounding()**` - Download rawinsonde measurement from sounding database of the University of Wyoming in a form convenient to use with `thundeR` package.


## Examples

Examples show aplication of thundeR package functions

#### Example 1

Plot sounding profile based on a sample vertical profile data

```{r example1, eval = TRUE, fig.width = 9, fig.height = 6, fig.fullwidth = TRUE}
library(thunder)
pressure <- c(1000, 855, 700, 500, 300, 100, 10) # pressure [hPa]
altitude <- c(0, 1500, 2500, 6000, 8500, 12000, 25000) # altitude [m above ground level]
temp <- c(25, 10, 0, -15, -30, -50, -92) # air temperature [°C]
dpt <- c(20, 5, -5, -30, -55, -80, -99) # dew point temperature [°C]
wd <- c(0, 90, 135, 180, 270, 350, 0) # wind direction [°]
ws <- c(5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 5, 0) # wind speed [kn]
sounding_plot(pressure, altitude, temp, dpt, wd, ws, 
              parcel = "MU", title = "Test thunder package")

```

### Example 2

Compute convective parameters with medium accuracy (~ 10x faster than high accuracy setting)

```{r example2, eval = TRUE}
sounding_compute(pressure, altitude, temp, dpt, wd, ws, accuracy = 2)
```


### Example 3

Draw wind barbs:

```{r example3, eval = TRUE, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 8, fig.fullwidth = TRUE}
par(mfrow=c(8,5), mar = c(0,0,1,1)) # set small margins
for (i in 1:40){
sc = 5
plot(0:2, xaxt = 'n', yaxt = 'n', type = "n")
text(1.4,1, i*sc, cex = 1.5)

### 2. Accuracy tables for `sounding_compute()` 

The interpolation algorithm used in the `sounding_compute()` function impacts accuracy of parameters such as CAPE or CIN and the performance of the script. The valid options for the `accuracy` parameter are 1, 2 or 3:

`accuracy = 1` - High performance but low accuracy. Dedicated for large dataset when output data needs to be quickly available (e.g. operational numerical weather models). This option is around 20 times faster than high accuracy (3) setting. Interpolation is peformed for 60 levels (m AGL): 

```{r accuracy1, echo = FALSE}
c(0, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000, 1100, 1200, 1300, 1400, 1600, 1800, 2000, 2200, 2400, 2600, 2800, 3000, 3200, 3400, 3600, 3800, 4000, 4200, 4400, 4600, 4800, 5000, 5200, 5400, 5600, 5800, 6000, 6500, 7000, 7500, 8000, 8500, 9000, 9500, 10000, 10500, 11000, 11500, 12000, 12500, 13000, 13500, 14000, 15000, 16000, 17000, 18000, 19000, 20000)
```

`accuracy = 2` - Compromise between script performance and accuracy. Recommended for processing large numerical weather prediction datasets such as meteorological reanalyses for research studies. This option is around 10 times faster than high accuracy (3) setting. Interpolation is peformed for 318 levels (m AGL): 

```{r accuracy2, echo = FALSE}

`accuracy = 3`: High accuracy but low performance setting. Recommended for analysing individual profiles. Interpolation is performed with 5 m vertical resolution step up to 20 km AGL (i.e.: `0, 5, 10, ... 20000` m AGL)

### Performance comparison:

```{r performace, echo=TRUE}
t1 = system.time(sounding_compute(pressure, altitude, temp, dpt, wd, ws, accuracy = 1))
t2 = system.time(sounding_compute(pressure, altitude, temp, dpt, wd, ws, accuracy = 2))
t3 = system.time(sounding_compute(pressure, altitude, temp, dpt, wd, ws, accuracy = 3))
print(t1)
print(t2)
print(t3)
```

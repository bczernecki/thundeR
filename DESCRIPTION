Description: Collection of functions for rapid computation and visualisation of convective parameters commonly used in the operational prediction of severe convective storms. Core algorithm is based on a highly optimized C++ code linked into R via Rcpp. Highly efficient engine allows to derive thermodynamic and kinematic parameters from large numerical datasets such as reanalyses or operational Numerical Weather Prediction models in a reasonable amount of time. Package has been developed since 2017 by research meteorologists specializing in severe thunderstorms.

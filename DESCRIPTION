Description: Collection of functions for rapid computation and visualisation of convective parameters commonly used in the operational prediction of severe convective storms. Core algorithm is based on a highly optimized 'C++' code linked into 'R' via 'Rcpp'. Highly efficient engine allows to derive thermodynamic and kinematic parameters from large numerical datasets such as reanalyses or operational Numerical Weather Prediction models in a reasonable amount of time. Package has been developed since 2017 by research meteorologists specializing in severe thunderstorms.
